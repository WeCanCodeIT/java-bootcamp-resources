### Classes in Java
- Some are imported (like Scanner, HashMap, ArrayList)
- Some are built in to the java.lang package and do not require imports, like String
- Knowing what classes you want to access will help provide you with the tools (methods) needed to solve a problem
- We will learn several different types of classes that are useful in software development
- the . (dot operator) in Eclipse is your friend!
