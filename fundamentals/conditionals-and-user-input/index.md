#### User Input
- **import java.util.Scanner;**
- Create an input object: **Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);**
- 4 Basic Steps to User Input Problem Solving
  1. Set up needed variables
  2. Gather input from user through data entry
  3. Create formula or decision structure needed to solve the problem
  4. Display output result 

## Goals
- Students should know the process to gather user input
- Students should understand the tools required to program user input entries
