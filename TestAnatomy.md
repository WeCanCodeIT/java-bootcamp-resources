### Unit Test Patterns
#### Arrange-Act-Assert
From http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert:
> Each method should group these functional sections, separated by blank lines:
>  1. Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs.
>  2. Act on the object or method under tet.
>  3. Assert that the expected results have occurred.
