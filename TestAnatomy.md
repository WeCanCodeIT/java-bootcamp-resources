### Unit Test Patterns
#### Arrange-Act-Assert
From http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert:
> Each method should group these functional sections, separated by blank lines:
> 1. Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs.
> 1. Act on the object or method under test.
> 1. Assert that the expected results have occurred.
