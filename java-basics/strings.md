## The String Class

## Goals
- Students should understand what a class is 
- Students should understand the concept of accessing classes as a tool to solving their programming problems
- Students should understand some of the powerful String methods available to them

## Resources
- [String Methods](https://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/ap/subset/doc/ap/java/lang/String.html)
- [String Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java/java-strings)

### Classes in Java
- Some are imported (like Scanner, HashMap, ArrayList)
- Some are built in to the java.lang package and do not require imports, like String
- Knowing what classes you want to access will help provide you with the tools (methods) needed to solve a problem
- We will learn several different types of classes that are useful in software development
- the . (dot operator) in Eclipse is your friend! 


## Practice Problems

### Are they equal?

Ask the user for two Strings. Check and see if the two Strings are equal to each other. If they are, inform the the user that the Strings are equal; otherwise, inform the user that the Strings are not equal

#### Examples

```bash
Enter your first String:
Hello
Enter your second String:
World
The Strings Hello and World are not equal to each other.
```

### Verify a new password?

Ask the user to create a password. Then have the user enter the password again to verify there were no typing errors. Display a message if the user properly or improperly matched their password entries.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter your password:
Computer
Verify your password:
Computers
Your passwords did not match please try again.
```


### Make a user name

Ask the user to create a user name. Make sure the user name is at least 8 characters in length and that the user name contains the word "code" somewhere regardless of case. Greet the user by their user name if it is properly entered, otherwise inform the user they need to try again.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter your user name:
WeCanCodeIt

Hello WeCanCodeIt!.
```

```bash
Enter your user name:
WeCanDoIt

Improper user name. Please try again.
```
