## Practice Problems

### Are they equal?

Ask the user for two integers. Check and see if the two integers are equal to each other. If they are, inform the the user that the numbers are equal; otherwise, inform the user that the numbers are not equal

#### Examples

```bash
Enter your first number:
16
Enter your second number:
18
The numbers 16 and 18 are not equal to each other.
```

```bash
Enter your first number:
42
Enter your second number:
42
The numbers 42 and 42 are equal to each other.
```

### Even or Odd?

Ask the user for a number. Tell the user if that number is even or odd. 

```bash
Enter a number:
15
15 is an odd number.
```

```bash
Enter a number:
42
42 is an even number.
```

### Positive or Negative?

Asks the user for a number, then tell the user whether that number is positive or negative. What happens when the user enters 0? Is it positive or negative?

### A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y

Ask the user for a character, and tell the user whether it is a vowel or a consonant. *Tip: You can solve this problem using a switch condition with only one break statement.*

### Greater of Two

Ask the user to input two integer values. Print the greater value.

Extension: ask the user for three integers, then print the greatest value.

### Don't Be Mean

Ask the user for four integers. Calculate the mean (average) of these and display the result.
