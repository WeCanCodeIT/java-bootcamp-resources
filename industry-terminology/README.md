## Industry Terminology 

#### What are these words, terms, acronyms??? The programming world has their own lingo and we need to learn how to speak. Not only so you know what we are saying, but so you are industry ready when talking with potential employers.

## Week 1 Key Terms
- **Input**: what goes IN to the computer (whether it be commands entered on a keyboard or data from another computer
- **Output**: what is produced, or the product, can be a web page, an app, our text sent to the Eclipse console
- **Project**: a folder to house an application in Eclipse
- **Class**: created in Eclipse to house code that becomes the blueprint for an object [read more](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/input.html)
- **Object**: an instance of a class
- **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**: a shift from just writing logic towards writing about the objects we want to manipulate
- **camelCase**: naming convention used in Java to combine multiple words together. Ex: playerScore
- **Concatenation**: using + to join items to strings
- **Syntax**: in Java, a set of rules to define how code needs to be written
- **Condition**: evaluates to true or false (found in decision structures)
- **Wrapper Classes**: used to convert any data type into an object...primitive data types are not objects and do not belong to any class (examples can come later)

## Week 2 Key Terms
- **Conditional Statement**: Evaluates to either true or false...allows for executing decision structors or loops
- **Iteration**: A pass through a loop (lap)
- **Code Block**: Code contained within { }. Code Blocks are useful in loops
   while(condition){
     do this
     and this
     and this
     }
- **Initialization**: Assigning a variable a beginnig value
- **Array**: A data structure that contains a group of elements all sharing the same data type
- **Index(pl Indicies)**: Location of an item in an Array (begins at 0)
- **Traversal**: A loop that visits every element in the Array
- **Class**: created in Eclipse to house code that becomes the blueprint for an object [read more](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/input.html)
- **Object**: an instance of a class
- **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**: a shift from just writing logic towards writing about the objects we want to manipulate
- **Constructor**: shares the same name as the class, has no data type, **constructs** the object 

## Week 3 Key Terms
- **API**: (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of prewritten packages, classes, and interfaces with their respective methods, fields and constructors.
- **Abstraction**: a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.
- **Parameterized Type**: requirement to use a data type parameter (Specify what Class something belongs to)


## Week 4 Key Terms
- **Inheritance**: The process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields-variables) of another
- **Child, Derived, Subclass**: The class that inherits these properties
- **Superclass, Base, Parent**: The class whose properties are inherited
- **Is-A Relationship**: The way we think of/define inheritance in Java
- **instanceof**: Tests the is-a relationship with a boolean result
- **extends**: Creates a subclass of a superclass
- **super**: similar to the this keyword it serves 2 main functions
            - invokes the superclass constructor from the subclass
            - used to differentiate methods of superclass from methods of the subclass if they have the same names
- **Abstract**: may or may not have an abstract method...has to be abstract if there is a method with no implementation. You cannot create an instance of an abstract class..if you inherit an abstract class you must code the abstract methods (called **implementation**)
- **Interface**: contains method signatures with no implementation and/or fields of specific duties, if an interface is implemented all methods must be implemented in the class 
- **Implements**: Key word to give access to an interface by a class
- **Polymorphism**: Having many forms
- **Encapsulation**: The process of hiding information about an object from other objects
- **Method Override**: Method inherited by a child class that has been altered
- **Kata**: A term said to be coined by programmer David Thomas, that relates to coding in reference to a pattern of 
            movements in Japanese martial arts. Students of a kata study it was a form, not as a conclusion.
            It is not the conclusion that matters but the steps that lead to the conclusion.

## Week 5 Key Terms
- **Boot-strap**: To quickly start up
- **Stand-alone Application**: A program that does not require operating system's services to run
- **Spring Framework**: Makes it easy to create stand-alone, production grade Spring based apps you can "just run"
- [**REST**](https://www.service-architecture.com/articles/web-services/representational_state_transfer_rest.html): Representational State Transfer
- **Rest Controller**: Executes when a user makes a request
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: an architecture used to develop flexible web applications

## Week 7 Key Terms
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language: A domain specific language used for designing and managing data in a Relational Database
- **RDBMS: Relational Database Management System**: a database management system based on the relational model
- **JDBC: Java Database Connectivity**: an API (Application Programming Interface) for Java that specifies how a client may access a database
- **H2**: A RDBMS written in Java and can support both in memory(temporary during run time and persistent databases
- **JPA**: Java Persistence API: A Java specification for accessing, persisting and managing data between Java objects and classes and Relational Databases
- **CRUD** Repository: **Create, Read, Update, Delete**

## Week 8 Key Terms
- **Mutable**: Can be changed
- **DOM**: Document Object Model: a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document
- **CDN**: [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)
